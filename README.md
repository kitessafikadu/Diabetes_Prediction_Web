# Diabetes Prediction App

This is a diabetes prediction application built using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **FastAPI**. The app allows users to input relevant health data, which is then processed by a machine learning model via a FastAPI backend to predict the likelihood of diabetes.

## Features

- **Frontend** built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend** built with FastAPI for handling user input and performing machine learning predictions.
- Users can input features such as age, BMI, blood pressure, glucose level etc.
- Prediction is done using a pre-trained machine learning model (you can include your model here).
- User-friendly interface with modern design elements.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - React
  - Tailwind CSS
  - Axios (for API calls)

- **Backend**:
  - FastAPI
  - Python
  - Scikit-learn
